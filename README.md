# xrp-portkey
XRP-Portkey is a headless Raspberry Pi travel node that auto-joins saved Wi-Fi and tunnels all traffic through a chosen Tailscale exit node. Optional Ethernet sharing lets a laptop/TV ride the encrypted tunnel. Includes boot automation, helper scripts, verification, and guidance to preserve the same 100.x IP after reinstall.
